# Review criteria

Before preparing to submit the assignment, pay attention to the following criterions. Try to complete most of them and present results in a form that can be easily assessed.

## Clarity
* The clear step-by-step instruction on how to produce the final submit file is provided
* Code has comments where it is needed and meaningful function names

## Feature preprocessing and generation with respect to models
* Several simple features are generated
* For non-tree-based models preprocessing is used or the absence of it is explained

## Feature extraction from text and images
* Features from text are extracted
* Special preprocessings for text are utilized (TF-IDF, stemming, levenshtening...)

## EDA
* Several interesting observations about data are discovered and explained
* Target distribution is visualized, time trend is assessed

## Validation
* Type of train/test split is identified and used for validation
* Type of public/private split is identified

## Data leakages
* Data is investigated for data leakages and investigation process is described
* Found data leakages are utilized

## Metrics optimization
* Correct metric is optimized

## Advanced Features I: mean encodings
* Mean-encoding is applied
* Mean-encoding is set up correctly, i.e. KFold or expanding scheme are utilized correctly

## Advanced Features II
* At least one feature from this topic is introduced

## Hyperparameter tuning
* Parameters of models are roughly optimal

## Ensembles
* Ensembling is utilized (linear combination counts)
* Validation with ensembling scheme is set up correctly, i.e. KFold or Holdout is utilized
* Models from different classes are utilized (at least two from the following: KNN, linear models, RF, GBDT, NN)
